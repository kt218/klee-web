### **Objective:** 
Write function that sorts an array in ascending order by modifying the input array.

<br>

It should also follow the function declaration below:
```c
void sort(int[], int);
```
<br>
<br>

### **Example**
 An array:
```
[5]
```
will be sorted as `[5]` as there is only one element.

However, the array below:
```
[5, 2, 3, 1, 4]
```
will sort, in ascending order, the original input array as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
